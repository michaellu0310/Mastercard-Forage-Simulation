# MasterCard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience
## Introduction

This repository showcases my work from the [MasterCard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/mastercard/cybersecurity-t8ye), where I focused on identifying phishing emails and creating educational content around them. I successfully analyzed suspicious emails to identify potential phishing attempts and then crafted a realistic phishing email scenario. To further reinforce the learning, I developed a PowerPoint presentation aimed at teaching employees how to recognize phishing emails and protect themselves from such threats. This experience has sharpened my skills in phishing detection, social engineering, and cybersecurity awareness training.

**Key Skills**:
- Phishing Detection
- Social Engineering Techniques
- Email Analysis
- Threat Simulation
- Cybersecurity Awareness Training
- Presentation Skills

## Task 1: Email Identification & Phishing Email Crafting
In task 1, my goal is to identify phishing emails and attempt social engineering to get employees to fall for a phishing campaign email.

The full email reads:
```
From: Mastercard Staff Support
To: employee@gmail.com

Subject: Mastercard: Password reset

Hello (insert name),

Your password has been changed.
If you did not make this request, please [reset your password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) to protect your account.

For any questions or concerns, please contact mastercardsupport@email.com

Thanks for helping us maintain your account's security.
```
The reason why email should work for most is because it looks like a legitimate email to reset password. The only giveaway I can think of when I crafted this email is to contact 'mastercardsupport@gmail.com'. A large company or business email should have their own email domain, especially from MasterCard.

## Task 2: Simulation Results & Employee Training
In task 2, we compile the results and prepare a PowerPoint presentation to teach employees how to identify and deal with phishing attempts.

## Challenges & Solutions
Challenge #1: To able to contextualize the importance of the phishing email attempt for the specific employee without sounding suspicious

Solution #1: The phishing email was made to be sound more generic and bland which would push urgency to fix a problem that doesn't exist

#

Challenge #2: Make the presentation not boring

Solution #2: Present data that would show who may be a victim to these phishing attempts so they are more inclined to follow along
